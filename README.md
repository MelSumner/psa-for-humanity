# PSAs for Humanity

I don't understand why humans are so stupid, despite having all of the knowledge of the world constantly available. In order to try to cope with this, I'm compiling public service announcements (PSAs) and making a little website out of them. 

## Contributing

If you want to contribute a PSA, that's cool. This site uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) for now, mostly because I wanted an excuse to try it out. So if you know how to use that, PRs that add content are welcome. Please don't submit any PRs to change the file structure or any of that kind of stuff. If you have ideas for artwork, those are fine to add. 

If you don't know how to use 11ty but you want to add some content, [open an issue](https://github.com/MelSumner/psa-for-humanity/issues) and put the content in there, and I'll add the content for you and attribute it to you. I might do something more fancy to accept content at a later date.
